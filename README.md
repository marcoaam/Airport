Airport Test
=================

Week 4 test at Makers Academy.

Airport control program that manages planes and involves random weather. Usually is not stormy but planes can not take of or land if the weather is stormy so watch out for the weather.

I wrote this code TDD with RSpec. The main goal was to write clean code, Object Oriented design and TDD.
